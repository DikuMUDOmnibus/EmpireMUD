an imperial serpent stiletto~
An imperial serpent stiletto is staked in the sand.~
   This long, thin dagger has a handle in the shape of a snake. A thin groove
runs from the snake's mouth at the hilt, down to the end of the blade, perhaps
for holding a bead of poison as it is driven into the hearts of your enemies.
