anat chains~
the chains of Anat~
The chains of Anat lie broken on the ground (list, buy).~
   These chains are huge, meant to bind the war-goddess Anat, the most feared
foe of the ancient world. Anat killed men and gods alike as she walked the
world, drenched in blood. Unfortunately, these chains are broken and it seems
she walks the Earth again. Seek out Anat -- hopefully she hasn't gotten far.

The golden chain of the old god Anat is dangling here.~
   This fine golden chain is so long that it loops dozens of times around your
neck, enough to protect your heart from mortal strikes. The chain is impossibly
